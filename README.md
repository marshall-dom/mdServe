## Overview

This application will spin up a web server to display a markdown file in your browser.
I typically take class notes and complete assignments in markdown, so I wrote
this tool quickly to serve a need. I plan to make this more robust as well as add additional
features in the future.


## Usage

From your working directory, execute the following command:

```bash
mdServe [filename.md]
```

By default, the server will listen on port 3030.
